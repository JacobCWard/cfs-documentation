## 10.16.2.2 Flow-Mediated and NTG-Induced Vasodilation

Flow-mediated vasodilation will be calculated as the percent change in the mean diameter between the 1-minute post-cuff release diameter and the baseline image. NTG-induced vasodilation will be assessed as above at baseline and after 5 minutes, and will be calculated as the percent changed in the diameter between the post-NTG and pre-NTG diameters.

Pulse Wave Doppler measurements will be made using velocity time integral (VTI) or TAM velocity of the Doppler flow signal by averaging 3 consecutive beats. Heart rate will be recorded from the ECG. Flow-mediated vasodilation or NTG vasodilation will be expressed as the increase in diameter divided by the respective baseline diameter, multiplied by 100%.
