## 10.11.2 PW Doppler Acquisiton

1. While in zoom, a sample volume (SV) will be placed in the lumen ad adjusted so that the SV length includes the entire diameter of the lumen.
2. The zoom function will be turned off to make certain the footprint of the linear scanhead is still parallel with the length of the artery, by checking that the proximal and distal diameters are equal.
3. The 1cm zoom box will be turned on without engaging the zoom and the spectral Doppler trace will be activated. This unzoomed duplex view will simultaneously show proper scanhead location and angle, location of the 1cm zoom box along the artery, size, angle, and location of SV along the artery, its position within the zoom box and the quality of the PW spectral signal.
4. Once everything is properly adjusted, the zoom function will be engaged and PW Doppler acquisition will be continued until there is one, high quality sweep, free of any arrhythmia.
