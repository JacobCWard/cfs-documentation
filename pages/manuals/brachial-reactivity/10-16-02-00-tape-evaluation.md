## 10.16.2 Videocassette Tape Evaluation

All videocassette tapes will be scanned to determine whether the images are technically adequate for interpretation. The technician will scan the videocassette tape to acquire the best quality baseline images of the artery and flow velocity as well as to identify the time point of maximum dilation achieved in response to hyperemia (defined by one minute post-cuff release) and NTG.

The image to be used in the analysis will be determined by ____________. A paper copy of that image will be printed and used or measurements. The ___________ will measure the diameter and velocity independently.

At the specified time points, end-diastolic (simultaneous with the R wave on the ECG recorded on the videocassette tape during the procedure) frames will be selected for analysis. When possible, arterial segments, a fixed distance from an anatomic marker, will be chosen for analysis at each time point to achieve consistency.
