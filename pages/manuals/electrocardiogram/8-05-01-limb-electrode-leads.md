## 8.5 Electrode Placement

### 8.5.1 Limb Electrode Leads

Begin with the **RIGHT LEG**. This is an important connection as this is the ground connection. A careless skin electrode connection here will influence all ECG leads.

1. On the inner side of the right leg (between the knee and ankle, traditionally placed a few inches above the ankle on the front), place a dot with a felt tip pen or a wax cosmetic pencil.
2. Prepare an area about 1-2 inches in diameter. Use firm circular motions with the alcohol gauze. Rub about 10 times or until skin becomes red. For participants with dark skin, rub 10 times.
3. Re-mark the position with your marker.
4. Repeat this procedure for the **LEFT LEG**.
5. Proceed to prepare the **RIGHT ARM** inner side (between the wrist and elbow on the supine side).
6. Mark and prepare the skin and re-mark the location.
7. Repeat this procedure for the **LEFT ARM**.
8. Place the limb electrodes on the four sites prepared and marked, starting with the right leg.
9. Use the newest type disposable silver chloride electrodes. These disposable electrodes do not need electrode paste, yield better ECGs, and offer other advantages. <u>Do not</u> connect electrode cables until you have completed preparations for the chest electrodes.
