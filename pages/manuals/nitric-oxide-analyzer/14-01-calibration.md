## 14.1 Calibration

### 14.1.1 Start Mode Procedure

* 1. Connect the RS-232 cable to the laptop
* 2. Turn on nitric oxide analyzer power using switch on back. Warm-up time is 15 minutes
* 3. Connect regulator to oxygen outlet and set to 10 PSIG.  This is already set in Room 685 and is usually connected to the wall.
* 4. From main menu, Press **Clear** to display status screen
* 5. Verify the following:

 * Cooler Temp -12 ± 0.2 PSIG (Adjust black knob on back)
 * Supply pressure 6.0 ± 0.2 PSIG
 * Cell Pressure >300 torr

* 6. Press **Clear** to return to main menu
* 7. With the **Analyzer** option highlighted, press **Enter**
* 8. From the analyzer menu, select **Start**. The NOA <u>must</u> be in start mode to perform a calibration

## 14.1.2 Calibration Gas Procedure

Two or three gas calibrations should be performed to make sure that the calibration is not drifting. Replicated gas calibrations should agree to the third decimal place

1. Connect sample tubes to one leg of the tee.
2. Open valve on calibration gas cylinder. No minimum, just open.  This is the harder tube used in calibration.
3. From the Calibration Menu, select **Calib Gas** to display the instruction screen
4. Allow the NOA to draw calibration gas through the machine for approximately 2-5 minutes.
5. You may start calibration after 2 minutes
6. Press **Enter** to display the gas concentration screen.
7. The default concentration of calibration gas is 45 ppm. Press **Enter** to accept the default.
8. Select **PPM&PPB** to calibrate both ranges.
9. Press **Enter** to accept first calibration.
10. Repeat two-three times. Must be within .002.
11. <u>TURN OFF THE GAS TANK</u>.
12. Disconnect the tubing from the tank.
13. Leave the machine running for testing.

    <strong>Note:</strong>
    If you are going to let the machine set for any length of time you should attach the tubing to the zero air filter.
