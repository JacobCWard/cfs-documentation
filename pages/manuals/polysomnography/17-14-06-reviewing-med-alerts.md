## 17.14.6 Reviewing Medical Alerts

After reviewing the study, the PI has to sign the QS form in the box in Medical Alert sections.  Additional comments can be entered on the form in the Comments section (comments placed elsewhere will not be entered into database and sent to the site). The scorer enters the reviewed study into Medical Alert Log Book. If there were changes in scoring were made during revision, new reports need to be created, printed and saved.
