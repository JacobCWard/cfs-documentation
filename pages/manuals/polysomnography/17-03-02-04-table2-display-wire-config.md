| GRD     | One gold cup electrode (Cz ground)(green)                              |


**<u>NOTE</u>:** You may want to separately gather all right sided electrodes (C4, A2, EOG/R) and all left sided electrodes (C3, A1, EOG/L) and secure them through a styrofoam cup that has had a hole punched into its bottom. This may prevent tangling, and help with easier identification during placement.

Oximeter Probe and Nasal Cannula are attached directly to the Control Module. Both of these use a clear plastic adaptor. The nasal cannula goes into the airflow port, NOT pressure port (the pressure port is for administering CPAP titration which we do not do).

When observing CPAP, use nasal cannula, cut tubing into CPAP mask port. You can tape to secure. Make sure tubing is not obstructed inside mask. If mask does not have ports in mask, then do not do pressure measure at all.
