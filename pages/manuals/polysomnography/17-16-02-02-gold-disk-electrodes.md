## 17.16.2.2 Gold Disk Electrodes

General cleaning followed by high- level disinfection.

1. In an especially reserved bowl, soak gold cups in warm water to help soften dried electrolyte paste.
2. Use a soft bristle nylon brush (i.e.: electrode brush, nail brush or toothbrush) to remove all traces of paste.
3. Empty bowl and rinse gold disks under running water.  Return electrodes to the bowl.
4. In the bowl holding the electrodes, create a dilute solution of household bleach and water using 24 oz. water to Â½ oz. bleach.  (This is approximately a 1:50 bleach/water ratio).
5. Allow electrodes to soak in bleach solution for 20 minutes.  Float any brush used in the same bowl, bristle-side down.
6. After 20 minutes, remove brush and electrodes from solution. Rinse electrodes under running water.  Dry and place into storage for next use.
7. Discard bleach solution from bowl and dry the bowl.
8. Place cleaning brush into bowl and store for next use.
