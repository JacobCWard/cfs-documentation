## 17.8.3 Step 3: Apply EEG Scalp Electrodes (Gold Disk)

The process for placing EEG sensors on the adult participant will follow the 10-20 system for electrode placement.  This standard was developed to provide consistent application of EEG electrodes for the collection of brain waves.  This system is based on measurements from 4 standard points (landmarks): the nasion, inion, and left and right pre-auricular points (see glossary for definitions).

* Electrodes must be placed in the correct locations to yield valid data.
* Electrode sites must be properly prepared prior to electrode placement to insure tight bonding and low impedance values.
* Secure attachment of gold disk electrodes is crucial to successful recording of data.
