## 17.5 The Setting

Set up can be done in any comfortable chair. Clear a flat surface area to set up supplies. Set all materials on a tray or disposable pad and position for easy access.  Have the subject sit close to your supply tray during hookup. Make sure you have easy access to subject's head, chest, etc.

If the participant has not taken a shower (24 hrs.) prior to your arrival, ask him/her to wash his/her face and chest with soap and water before applying electrodes.  Explain that the electrodes will adhere better and a better study will be produced if the skin is cleansed in this manner.

**<u>NOTE</u>:** If the setting is poorly lighted, you may consider using a camping style headlamp to help illuminate the scalp, the neck and other areas in which placement is critical.
