## 17.16.2 Cleaning and Disinfection of Equipment

### 17.16.2.1 Methods for Cleaning/Disinfection

* It is recommended to wear gloves when handling contaminated electrodes requiring disinfection.
* Disinfection in areas of food preparation such as the kitchen sink is discouraged.  Use a utility sink, laundry area or toilet for disposal of any liquids used for soaking.

A decontamination procedure with dilute bleach for gold disk electrodes is well established.  This procedure for the non-disposable Compumedics thermistor has not been adequately bench tested to study for incidence of corruption through repeated cycles.

Compumedics has requested all technicians to tag each thermistor and mark each time the electrode has completed a cycle of use and disinfection.  This information will be used as an adjunct to laboratory bench testing performed by Compumedics.  Thermistors with evidence of poor signal quality after cyclic use should be brought to the direct attention of Steve Johnson at Compumedics, USA.

High-level disinfection is appropriate to inactivate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis).  High-level disinfection destroys all microorganisms except bacterial spores, to which intact mucous membranes are resistant.
