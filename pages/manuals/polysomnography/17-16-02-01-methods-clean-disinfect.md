## 17.16.2 Cleaning and Disinfection of Equipment

### 17.16.2.1 Methods for Cleaning/Disinfection

* It is recommended to wear gloves when handling contaminated electrodes requiring disinfection.
* Disinfection in areas of food preparation such as the kitchen sink is discouraged.  Use a utility sink, laundry area or toilet for disposal of any liquids used for soaking.

A decontamination procedure with dilute bleach for gold disk electrodes is well established.  This procedure for the non-disposable Compumedics thermistor has not been adequately bench tested to study for incidence of corruption through repeated cycles.

Compumedics has requested all technicians to tag each thermistor and mark each time the electrode has completed a cycle of use and disinfection.  This information will be used as an adjunct to laboratory bench testing performed by Compumedics.  Thermistors with evidence of poor signal quality after cyclic use should be brought to the direct attention of Steve Johnson at Compumedics, USA.

High-level disinfection is appropriate to inactivate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis).  High-level disinfection destroys all microorganisms except bacterial spores, to which intact mucous membranes are resistant.

### 17.16.2.2 Gold Disk Electrodes

General cleaning followed by high- level disinfection.

1. In an especially reserved bowl, soak gold cups in warm water to help soften dried electrolyte paste.
2. Use a soft bristle nylon brush (i.e.: electrode brush, nail brush or toothbrush) to remove all traces of paste.
3. Empty bowl and rinse gold disks under running water.  Return electrodes to the bowl.
4. In the bowl holding the electrodes, create a dilute solution of household bleach and water using 24 oz. water to ½ oz. bleach.  (This is approximately a 1:50 bleach/water ratio).
5. Allow electrodes to soak in bleach solution for 20 minutes.  Float any brush used in the same bowl, bristle-side down.
6. After 20 minutes, remove brush and electrodes from solution. Rinse electrodes under running water.  Dry and place into storage for next use.
7. Discard bleach solution from bowl and dry the bowl.
8. Place cleaning brush into bowl and store for next use.

### 17.16.2.3 Thermistor

General cleaning followed by high- level disinfection.

1. Clean the thermistor by wiping with gauze saturated Goo-Gone. Pay particular attention to remove any debris, which may be on the object.
2. Wipe thermistor again with a gauze soaked with Fantastik
3. Spray thermistor with Control III Elite.
4. Allow thermistor to sit for at least 10 minutes.
5. After 10 minutes dry thermistor with a clean cloth or paper towel. Store in clean bag for the next patient use.

### 17.16.2.4 Oximeter Probe, Position Sensor, and ECG Electrode Wires

General cleaning that also provides low-level disinfection

1. Provide initial cleaning by wiping these objects with a soft cloth which has been saturated with Goo-Gone.  Pay particular attention to remove any debris that may be on the object.
2. Wipe down again with gauze saturated with Fantastik.
3. Allow to air dry. Place in clean bag for next patient use.

### 17.16.2.5 Respiratory Band Covers

General cleaning

1. After each use, wash the black covers in a solution of warm water and mild soap.
2. Rinse and allow to air dry.
3. Place dry covers into storage for next use.
4. Do not attempt to clean the white inductance band electrodes.  The use of the black covers eliminates the need to clean these sensitive electrodes.  If desired, the black electrode wires may be wiped with alcohol however, this is not necessary since they do not come into contact with the participant’s skin.
