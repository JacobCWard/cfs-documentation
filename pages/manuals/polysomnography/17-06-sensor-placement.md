## 17.6 Sensor Placement

Proper sensor placement is very important for effectively recording sleep patterns.  Because you will be connecting the sensors to the patient, you should become familiar with each sensor and learn how to correctly place and connect them.  All sensors should be labeled to simplify their identification and connections.

    <strong>Note:</strong>
    When connecting the sensors, be sure to hold the sensors by the ends, **not** by the wires.  Also, for cleanliness, use non-sterile patient-care gloves when applying electrodes.

Below are general rules for good sensor placement:

* Have subject shampooed, shaved, showered and in bedclothes.
* Prep only areas of skin that electrodes cover.
* Use only small pieces of tape but enough to secure the sensor and wires.
* Provide for "stress" in wire/cables.
* Secure loose wires/cables with tape.
* Use non-dominant hand for oximeter placement.

You will use 13 electrodes (2 ground [Cz and Ref], C3, C4, O1, O2, A1, A2, left EOG, right EOG, 3 chin EMG, and 2 ECG [snaps]).  You also will be using abdomen and chest belts, an oximeter, thermistor, a snore microphone, nasal cannula, leg sensors and a body position sensor.
