## 17.16.3 Masimo Calibration Procedures

1. Open your E-series monitor the way you normally would for the Family sleep study. Do not enter patient information or study montage until you are done calibrating. Do not start recording until you are done calibrating.
2. Make sure that you have Monitor #1413. Make sure that the Masimo is plugged in to channel 56 of the DC module for this unit. Also make sure that you have chosen Masimo2 as the study configuration.  You can do this in New by just selecting the **study config**.
3. Single click on **View**. Nothing will be scrolling on the screen at this point.
4. Single click on **Edit**.
5. Single click on **Physical Channels** on the left part of the screen.
6. Scroll down to **Masimo**.
7. Right click on **Masimo** in the right hand column. Choose **Modify Calibration**.
8. This will bring up the calibration screen. This is very similar to calibrating the position sensor.
9. Make sure that you have placed a Masimo oximeter on a person and powered the unit on. Connect the oximeter cord to the finger sensor. Wait about 30 seconds for the unit to get a good signal from the person. Ideally, you would like someone who has SpO2 values of 100%. But, 97% to100% is acceptable.
10. Using the gray buttons on the left hand side of the read-out, press the second button from the top (has a 3-page picture next to it) once.
11. Menu should appear on the screen. Using the gray button up and down arrows, go down to the **Output** option.
12. Press the second button down which corresponds to the single page picture.
13. Use the down button to get to the **Analog 1** option.
14. Press the second gray button which corresponds to the single page picture. The single page will turn into a check mark telling you that you are changing something.
15. Use the up and down arrows again to get to the **0V Output** option.
16. Press the checkmark to select (gray button next to it).
17. Go to the Compumedics computer now.
18. In the calibration screen, next to the **‘0’** value, select click **Acquire**.
19. Go back to the Masimo unit.
20. Press the second gray button which corresponds to the single page picture. The single page will turn into a check mark telling you that you are changing something.
21. Use the up and down arrows to get to the **1V Output** option.
22. Press the second gray button which corresponds to the single page picture.
23. Go back to the Compumedics computer.
24. Next to the ‘100’-value click on **Acquire**.  **<u>NOTE</u>:** If you do any of this too slowly, the Masimo unit will revert back to the main screen and you will have to start over. Make sure that you make selections and do not leave them unselected. The unit thinks you are not changing anything and will revert back to the main menu.
25. After you have acquired that value, click on **Set Calibration**.
26. Select **OK** to update calibration.
27. Single click on **Edit**.
28. Select **File**.
29. Select **Save Study Configuration**.
30. A drop down menu will appear. Use the arrow in the drop down menu to scroll down to **Masimo2**. Make sure Masimo2 is highlighted.
31. Select **OK**.
32. It will give you a message, ‘This configuration already exists. Do you want to overwrite it?’ Select **OK**.
33. Go back to the Masimo.
34. Use the second gray button to select **Analog 1** in Output menu.
35. Use the up and down arrows to select **Sp02 0-100%**.
36. Use the second gray button to turn the checkmark back into the page picture.
37. To get out of these menus, use the first gray button with the X picture next to it until you get back to the screen with the % reading and pulse waveforms.
38. You are done with the calibration procedure. You can now set up your sleep study the way you normally would.
