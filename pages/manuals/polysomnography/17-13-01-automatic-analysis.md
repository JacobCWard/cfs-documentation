## 17.13.1 Automatic Analysis

The analysis, for the most part, is done completely by the program.  You will only need to set certain parameters for the computer to work with.

1. Pull up the study using the Profusion Software.
2. Page through the study and review.  Look for good readable signals, channel loss, or noisy signals.
 * **<u>NOTE</u>:** For running respiratory scoring, keep in mind that 3 signals can be used for the primary channel (airflow, thoracic effort, or abdominal effort).  When checking signals, choose the best looking signal for the primary channel.  Feel free to zoom in or out to ascertain the best channel.  The abdominal effort channel will most often be used.
3. From the drop down menu in Profusion, choose **Analysis**.
4. From Analysis, choose **Automatic Analysis**.
5. Make sure the following are checked: Respiratory Analysis, Offline Summary, Sleep Staging, PLM Analysis.
6. Click on the **Parameters** box. Review the parameters.
7. Click **OK**.
8. At the main Automatic Analysis menu, select **Channel Assignments**.
9. Select **Sleep**.  This is where you can choose/change channels if some of the signals are weak.
10. Select **Respiratory**.  This is where you can choose your primary and secondary channels for analyzing respiratory disturbances during the study.
11. The strongest/best signal in the study should be chosen as the primary channel, while the two weaker channels should be assigned the alternate positions. Normally, the primary channel should be Abdominal Effort.  The secondary channel (Effort 1) is Thoracic Effort.  The second alternative (Effort 2) is Airflow.
12. Select **OK**.
13. Select **Arousal**.
14. Make sure that ‘Same as Sleep Settings’ boxed is unchecked.
15. Go to the top three drop down menus marked with Resp Arousal, Spon Arousal, and Limb Arousal.  Choose **C3** for all three channels.
16. Select **OK**.
17. Select **Other**.
18. For the box labeled Left Leg, use the drop down menu and select **Left Leg**. Repeat for the box labeled Right Leg.
19. Select **OK**.
20. When back to the Automatic Analysis menu, select **OK**.
21. The automatic analysis process usually takes a while (normally 15-35 minutes or so).  Once the computer finishes running the automatic analysis, the computer will present you with a new screen.
22. Close the study and exit the Profusion 2 program.
