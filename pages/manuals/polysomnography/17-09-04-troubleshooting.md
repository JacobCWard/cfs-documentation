## 17.9.4 Troubleshooting Bad Signals

1. Determine where the ‘bad’ signal is coming from. Each channel is labeled on the computer screen. **<u>NOTE</u>:** The green lead in the middle of scalp and the gray lead on the middle of the forehead affects all EEG and EMG channels.  It is a good idea to check these leads if all channels are blocking or fuzzy.
2. Replace the electrode by re-cleaning the sight with appropriate cleaning solution.
3. Use the EC2 cream to anchor the electrode in place.
4. Check the signal to make sure your efforts were successful.
5. If you cannot fix the signal, you can call Heather. Document each attempt to fix a signal. It will help us to determine what went wrong.
6. **PLEASE PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE AIRFLOW SIGNAL.** Airflow signals should be checked visually at the participant’s nose to make sure the sensor is secure. If it is not, adjust as needed, even if it means disturbing the participant. We need this signal to determine airflow out of the nose and mouth.
