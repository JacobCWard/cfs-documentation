## 17.8.6 Step 6: Attach Thermistor

These are made of temperature sensitive wires which are positioned directly in the flow of air.

1. Thermistor should be placed under nasal area on participant’s upper lip so that the three-thermistor beads are exposed to the patient’s nasal and oral airflow. <u>See cannula attachment before attaching thermistor.</u>
2. Secure in place by looping wire around ear and taping wires over cheek.  The beads should not touch the lips, skin or nasal mucosa membranes.

**<u>NOTE</u>:** The thermistor is sensitive to displacement or moisture. Before leaving, show the participant (in a mirror) and/or a family member how the thermistor should be positioned. Show the participant how to re-adjust this, if needed.  Warn him to try and keep his upper lip dry.  Nighttime beverages should be consumed through a drinking straw.
