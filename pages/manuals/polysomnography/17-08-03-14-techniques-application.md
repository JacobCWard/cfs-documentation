## 17.8.3.14 Techniques for Disk Electrode Application

<u>Bare skin (face, mastoids):</u>

1. Using the gold disk as a scoop, fill the electrode cup with electrolyte paste so it is slightly rounded (there must be no “air pockets” which act to increase impedance).
2. Place the electrode onto the prepped site, paste side down and cover with a square of gauze or piece of tape (depending on your preference).
3. Press lightly on the top of the electrode as well as firmly around the rim of the cup to insure a good seal.  Hold in place until electrolyte begins to set and feels secure.
4. A larger second piece of tape may be placed over the electrode, if desired.

<u>Scalp with hair:</u>

1. Separate hairs to make sure skin is visible.
2. Using the above technique, fill the electrode cup with EC2 cream and attach to prepped site.
3. Place a small amount of EC2 cream on the gauze or tape used to cover the electrode.
4. Press firmly on electrode and hold in place until EC2 begins to set and feels secure.

<u>Bearded chins:</u>

1. Separate hairs of beard to make sure skin is visible.
2. Fill the electrode cup with EC2 cream and attach to prepped site.
3. After attaching electrode to skin, use cotton applicator to place small amount of EC2 cream on top of electrode.
4. Crisscross small amounts of beard hair over the electrode, as an anchor
5. Place a small amount of EC2 cream on the gauze or tape used to cover the electrode.
6. Press firmly on electrode and hold in place until EC2 begins to set and feels secure.

<u>After electrodes are applied:</u>

1. Gather electrode wires together just above nape of neck.
2. Bundle and secure with pieces of tape that have had the ends folded over for easy removal.
3. Bundle the wires approximately every 4-6 inches.  This reduces artifact and tangling.
