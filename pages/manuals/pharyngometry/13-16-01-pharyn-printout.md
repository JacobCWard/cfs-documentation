## 13.16 Score Pharyngometry Curves and Print Reports

### 13.16.1 The Pharyngometry Printout

The Pharyngometry Printout must be prepared for analysis prior to incorporation into the existing database.

Each maneuver is “graded” to insure quality data collection.  The judging criterion is a three-point scale:  1=PASS, 2=Fail and 3=EQUIVICAL.  Only tests judged to be a PASS are included in the analysis.

Test Quality is judged by the following criteria:

* Reproducibility
* Lack of “noise”
* Appropriate testing technique
* Readability of test

This figure represents the digital screen of the pharyngometry testing program.  This figure reveals the following:

* The two arrows are positioned on either side of the oropharynx on the main graph
* The far right of the main graph demonstrates the “off the chart” sailboat which indicates lack of a good seal on the mouthpiece.
* The four charts on the bottom of the display indicate the four tests (e.g., 1 nose and 3 mouth) Tests 2 through 4 (mouth) appropriately appear different from the test 1 (nose)
* Tests 2 through 4 are very consistent, up to about 19.0 on the Y axis, at which point they differ greatly
