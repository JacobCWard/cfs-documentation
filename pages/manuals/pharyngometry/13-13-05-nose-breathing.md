## 13.13.5 Nose Breathing

Gary Glass approved of these techniques, and suggested the nose holding technique, as a <u>final option</u> when all others have failed.

* One can tell the subject is nose-breathing because the dip after the oral cavity hits 0.  That is appropriate for the nose-breath trial, but be sure that for the mouth-breath” trial you attain proper data, with that same dip falling above zero.
* If the subject has trouble breathing through the mouth only, instruct them to inhale slowly though their mouth, and throat.  This may help.
* You may also ask them to blow out slowly – as if they were blowing up a balloon.
* As a last resort, you may have them hold their nose, so they will only breathe though their mouth.
