## 13.13 Troubleshooting Guidelines

### 13.13.1 We are Looking for That Area Between the Oropharyngeal Junction and the Epligotti, Called the Oropharynx

* A good example of this landmark would be represented on the below graphic _as the second smaller hill next to the first large hill on the graph_, between the two small triangles. Typically, this can be found in the first “hump” after the oral cavity – from the first “dip” to the second “dip”.  In some graphs, that area may be harder to identify.
* To locate the oropharynx on the Pharyngometry display screen, search about 10 cm “mouth-ward” of the glottis. This is the pharynx.  The glottis is the dip located at around 20 cm, corresponding to the narrow area around the vocal cords.  This landmark may then help us to locate the area we are interested in located just left of the pharynx
