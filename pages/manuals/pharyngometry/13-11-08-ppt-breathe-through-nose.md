## 13.11.8 Participant Continues to Breathe Through Nose When Asked to Breathe Through Mouth Only

* Subject is <u>not</u> allowed to hold nose closed with fingers or to use nose clips because it alters the data.
* Let subject know that although they feel like they are only breathing through their mouth, you still see simultaneous nose breathing.  Encourage them to keep trying to only breathe through mouth.  Give praise if it works.
* Show participant graph and describe what graph looks like with only mouth breathing compared to nasal breathing.
