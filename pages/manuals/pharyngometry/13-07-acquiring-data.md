## 13.7 Acquiring Data

1. Inform the subject to sit upright with good posture.
 * Make sure legs are uncrossed and feet are on the ground.
 * The participant should be facing forward with neck straight and the head sitting at a 90-degree angle in relationship to the neck.
2. Hold pharyngometer wave tube in front of the participant while they adjust the mouthpiece inside of their mouth.
3. Continue to hold the wave tube parallel to the floor and instruct the participant to keep the mouthpiece securely in their mouth by biting down on the bite blocks. The subject is to breathe normally from the mouth with the tube in place.
4. Make sure the subject is comfortable with breathing through the tube and not their nose.
Begin each set of trials when the participant takes a SLOW inhaled breath.  The participant should be only breathing through their mouth.
5. With the pharyngometer in place, and the subject demonstrating their understanding of proper procedure, press the **Enter** key.
 * A series of clicks will be heard, and the main graph will display incoming data.
 * Do not stop the pharyngometer until the minimum number of trials is completed (approx. 10 trials) which is indicated by a large, red dot appearing in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
 * The data trials should be close to overlapping which indicates a probably good accurate picture.
6. To stop the series of trials and capture the picture, press the **Enter** key
7. Using arrow keys, move to the next trial window and repeat the above steps trying to reproduce the previous picture. Three complete trial pictures should be obtained with subject breathing through their mouth.
8. Ask the participant to only breathe through their nose and obtain one trial picture.
9. Upon completion, there should be three reproducible trials with mouth breathing, and one trial with nasal breathing.
