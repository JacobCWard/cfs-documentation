## 13.13.3 The Tongue is Misplaced

* Tongue is most likely misplaced at the roof of the mouth
* Reposition the tongue; making sure that it is resting under the ledge of the mouthpiece.  If this fails, try inserting the mouthpiece without the wave tube attached, and look, with a flashlight, to see if placement is correct.
* For those individuals with “meaty tongues”, it may be possible that, even with correct placement of the mouthpiece, the graph will appear this way.  In that case, note that in the comment section.
