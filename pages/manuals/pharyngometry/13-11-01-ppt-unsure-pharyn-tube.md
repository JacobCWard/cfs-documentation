## 13.11 Common Participant Complains

### 13.11.1 Participant is Unsure of the Pharyngometry Tube

* **<u>To explain the mouthpiece</u>:** _“Have you ever gone snorkeling in a pool?  This is the same mouthpiece that you would use.”_ or _“This mouthpiece is similar to what a football player/basketball player wears.”_ (It helps if you know what sports the participant likes.)
* Allow participant to hold pharyngometer wave tube and put mouthpiece in and out of his mouth before beginning trials.
* Have participant practice breathing through the tube a few times.
