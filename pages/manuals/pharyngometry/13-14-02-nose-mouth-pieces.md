## 13.14.2 Nose and Mouth Pieces

Nose pieces and mouth pieces will be cleaned after every use.

1. Using soap and water, clean every mouth and nose piece to remove any obvious dirt.
2. Mix a solution of bleach and water in the container provided. The ratio of bleach to water is 1:50.
3. After the pieces have been soaking for at least 20 minutes, rinse the pieces with tap water.
4. Using the spray bottle labeled rubbing alcohol, spray the pieces (this will be a diluted to 1:2, alcohol to water). An alternative would be to rinse the pieces with sterile water after they have been disinfected.
5. Place on dry clean towels to air dry.
6. After the pieces are dry they will be placed in a plastic bag that will be marked ‘clean and disinfected’ with the date.
