## 13.3 Computer Setup

1. Assure that the pharyngometer is connected securely to the back of the computer in the appropriate jack (marked **oral**).
2. Turn on the power to the computer.  The pharyngometer must be connected to the computer <u>before</u> power is turned on so the computer recognizes it.
3. Turn on power to the laptop.
4. The Windows Main Screen will display several icons.
5. Select the icon labeled **Pharyngometry**.  (This icon is a short cut to running the Pharyngometry program from DOS.) This will bring up the Pharyngometry Data Acquisition Screen. This screen will display one large graph in the upper center of the screen (x-axis is labeled ‘distance’; y-axis is labeled ‘area’).  It will also simultaneously display four smaller graphs along the bottom of the screen; each is outlined with a different color.
