## 13.16.1.1 Figure 1: Digital Screen of Pharyngometry Testing Program

MISSING_IMAGE

This figure represents the digital screen of the pharyngometry testing program.  This figure reveals the following:

* The two arrows are positioned on either side of the oropharynx on the main graph
* The far right of the main graph demonstrates the “off the chart” sailboat which indicates lack of a good seal on the mouthpiece.
* The four charts on the bottom of the display indicate the four tests (e.g., 1 nose and 3 mouth) Tests 2 through 4 (mouth) appropriately appear different from the test 1 (nose)
* Tests 2 through 4 are very consistent, up to about 19.0 on the Y axis, at which point they differ greatly
