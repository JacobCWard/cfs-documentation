## 13.13.4 Oral Cavity Appears Artificially Large

* Very large (off the chart on top) oral cavities are likely that the subject is not creating a good seal around the mouthpiece or not resting their teeth on the “bite blocks” of the mouthpiece because the oral cavity appears artificially large.
* Instruct the subject to bite down, or to rest their teeth on the “bite blocks.”
* Also, the clicking sound will seem louder to the tester as the lips are not confining the sound to the mouth.
