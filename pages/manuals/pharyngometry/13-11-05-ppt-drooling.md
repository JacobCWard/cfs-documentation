## 13.11.5 Participant is Drooling A Lot

Problem with excessive drooling seems to be participant specific. We have found nothing to stop the drooling.  We only do things to possibly reduce the amount of drooling and to make the test more comfortable for the child in spite of the problem.

* Only do one or two trials before allowing the subject to take the tube out of his/her mouth and clear some of the saliva by swallowing a few times.
* Offer a tissue if needed.
