## 13.6 Participant Instruction

* Describe to participant that the tube is hollow and they can breathe through it and his/her breath will come out of the hole at the end of the tube.
* Instruct the subject how to place the scuba mouthpiece into his/her mouth. _“Put entire mouthpiece into your mouth and then move your teeth so you can bite down on the ‘bite block pieces.’ Make sure your lips are around the outside of the mouth piece so there is a good seal/no air can get in.”_
