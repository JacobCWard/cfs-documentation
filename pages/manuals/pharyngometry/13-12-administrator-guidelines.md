### 13.12.1 To Work the Computer While Simultaneously Holding Pharyngometer

* Have participant sit next to you and face straight ahead, so you can see the alignment of his/her head and neck throughout the testing.
* Hold pharyngometer tube so you can feel the subjectâ€™s breath going through the tube by placing your finger above the hole at the end of the tube while your other hand is free to manipulate the computer to run the trials.
