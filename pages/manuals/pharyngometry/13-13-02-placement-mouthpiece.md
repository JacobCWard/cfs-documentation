## 13.13.2 Placement of the Mouthpiece and Ways to Troubleshoot

* Be sure to use the **‘new’ mouthpieces** only!
* When testing, look for a sizeable oral cavity (but not much greater than 9 cm) and a dip almost to 0 on the nose-breath graph.
* For the next three mouth-breaths, look for a sizeable oral cavity (often around 3 cm) and clear curves with a minimum GREATER than 0 at the oropharynx.  This should be because the vellum will be open while mouth breathing, creating a larger area in the airway.  All three curves should be clear and reproducible.
