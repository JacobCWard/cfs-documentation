## 9.3.2.5 Tips for the Ankle-Arm Measurements

* Mark the location of maximal pulse or Doppler signal on the brachial artery and both posterior and tibial arteries with an eyeliner pencil to improve the speed and accuracy of localizing them the second time and to help maintain position
* Hold the Doppler pen <u>absolutely still</u> while inflating and deflating the cuff; moving a few millimeters will lose the pulse
* Always use enough jelly to ensure good contact
* The systolic value is the pressure level at which you hear the first of two or more swishing sounds in the appropriate rhythm. **<u>NOTE</u>:** A single sound heard in isolation (not in rhythmic sequence) before the first of the rhythmic sounds (systolic) does not alter the interpretation of blood pressure.
* Repeat measures and record. _If the second measure is >5mmHg than the previous measure made in the same site, then repeat._
