## 9.1 Background and Purpose

The ankle-arm index (AAI) is the ratio of the ankle to arm systolic blood pressure. It is reduced to less than 1.0 when there is obstruction to blood flow in legs. The AAI is a non-invasive measure of atherosclerotic obstruction in the legs and is a general marker of atherosclerotic burden. The degree of sub clinical and clinical arteriosclerosis is hypothesized to be related to the decline in lean mass and increase in abdominal adiposity with age. AAI is associated with atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds and predicts subsequent mortality and cardiovascular mortality. The impact of sub clinical cardiovascular disease on loss of bone and muscle mass and subsequent disability is not clear.
