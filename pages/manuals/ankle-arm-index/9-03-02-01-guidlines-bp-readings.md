## 9.3.2.1 Guidelines for Blood Pressure Readings

* Record all readings to the nearest even digit, rounding up (ex. read any value that appears to fall exactly between the markings on the mercury column to the next higher even marking).
* Make readings at the top of the meniscus, or rounded surface of the mercury columns
* When the pressure is released too quickly from a high level, a vacuum is formed above the mercury and the meniscus is distorted. Allow a few moments for it to reappear before reading the manometer or doing a repeat measurement.
