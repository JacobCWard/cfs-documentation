## 9.2.2 Safety Issues and Exclusions

If an exclusionary criterion exists for one leg, the AAI may still be performed using the other leg. If an exclusionary criterion exists for the participant, the AAI may not be performed.

Exclusionary criteria for a limb include:

* Legs with open wounds (including ulcers) or rashes
* Legs with amputations
* Artery cannot be occluded before the mercury column reaches 300 mm Hg (rigidity of artery)
* Sound cannot be heard

Exclusionary criteria for a participant include:

* Inability to lie flat or in a semi-recumbent position
* Flat or semi-recumbent is defined as the trunk being raised no more than 45 degrees from a flat surface parallel to the floor
* Bilateral amputation of legs or arms

The presence of exclusionary criteria for limbs and participants is recorded on the “Physical Measurements” (PM) form.
