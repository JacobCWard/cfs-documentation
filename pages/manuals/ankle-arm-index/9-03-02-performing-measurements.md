## 9.3.2 Performing the Measurements

Wait 30 seconds after determination of the maximal inflation level and follow the steps below for performing the blood pressure measurement:

### 9.3.2.1 Guidelines for Blood Pressure Readings

* Record all readings to the nearest even digit, rounding up (ex. read any value that appears to fall exactly between the markings on the mercury column to the next higher even marking).
* Make readings at the top of the meniscus, or rounded surface of the mercury columns
* When the pressure is released too quickly from a high level, a vacuum is formed above the mercury and the meniscus is distorted. Allow a few moments for it to reappear before reading the manometer or doing a repeat measurement.

### 9.3.2.2 Arm (Brachial) Systolic Blood Pressure Measurement

See <u>General Methods</u> for this measurement.

1. Participant should lay flat, straight knee. Feet will be flexed. Attach the cuff tubing to the manometer.
2. Turn the Doppler unit on.
3. Sit next to the participant’s arm.
4. Locate the brachial artery by palpation. If you need to, you can also locate the brachial artery by using the Doppler.
5. Apply more ultrasound jelly over brachial artery, if needed.
6. Locate brachial artery using the Doppler.
7. Measure the systolic blood pressure using the Doppler. Inflate the cuff quickly to the maximal inflation level
8. Deflate at 2-3 mm Hg per second to 10 mm Hg below the appearance of systolic pressure
9. Deflate the cuff quickly and completely.
10. Record systolic blood pressure in space provided for brachial BP on form.

### 9.3.2.3 Right Ankle Systolic Blood Pressure Measurement

1. Place the manometer between the participant’s ankles.
2. Locate the posterior tibial artery by palpation.
3. Apply more ultrasound jelly over posterior tibial artery if needed
4. Measure the systolic blood pressure using the Doppler.
5. Inflate the cuff quickly to the maximal inflation level. If sounds are still present, continue to inflate 10 mm Hg at a time, until the sound is obliterated.
6. Deflate at 2-3 mm Hg per second to 10 mm Hg below the appearance of systolic pressure
7. Deflate cuff quickly and completely.
8. Record the systolic value from the first reading in the space provided for right posterior tibial BP on the Physical Measurements (PM) form.

### 9.3.2.4 Left Ankle Systolic Blood Pressure Measurement

1. Repeat systolic blood pressure measurement as for right leg.
2. Record the systolic value from the first reading in the space provided for left posterior tibial BP on the form.
3. Wait at least 30 seconds.
4. Repeat the sequence immediately in the following order (reverse order from previous readings): left ankle, right ankle, right arm.
5. Review the form for completeness.
6. Remove the cuffs and conducting jelly.

### 9.3.2.5 Tips for the Ankle-Arm Measurements

* Mark the location of maximal pulse or Doppler signal on the brachial artery and both posterior and tibial arteries with an eyeliner pencil to improve the speed and accuracy of localizing them the second time and to help maintain position
* Hold the Doppler pen <u>absolutely still</u> while inflating and deflating the cuff; moving a few millimeters will lose the pulse
* Always use enough jelly to ensure good contact
* The systolic value is the pressure level at which you hear the first of two or more swishing sounds in the appropriate rhythm. **<u>NOTE</u>:** A single sound heard in isolation (not in rhythmic sequence) before the first of the rhythmic sounds (systolic) does not alter the interpretation of blood pressure.
* Repeat measures and record. _If the second measure is >5mmHg than the previous measure made in the same site, then repeat._
