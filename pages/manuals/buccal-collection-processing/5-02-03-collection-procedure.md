## 5.2.3 Collection Procedure

1.  Remove a Cytobrush Plus Cell Collector from the envelope touching only the “stick” end.
2.  Have the individual open his/her mouth.
3.  With either an up and down or back and forth motion, have the individual brush the inside of one side of his/her cheeks for 15-20 seconds.  Tell them to _“be gentle, but strong”_.  **MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON’T SCRAPE SO HARD THAT THE CHEEK BLEEDS OR BECOMES IRRITATED!**
4.  After 15-20 seconds, tell the individual to switch to the other side without turning the brush.
5.  Tell him/her to brush again on this side of their cheek for another 15-20 seconds.
6.  Place the brush end of the Cytobrush Plus Cell Collector in the appropriately labeled microcentrifuge tube.
7.  Ensure the correct individual’s Participant ID number is on the cap of the tube and the first name is on a removable piece of tape on the outside of the tube.
8.  Verify the name and Participant ID number is correct with a second person.
9.  Cut the stick with wire-cutters or a pair of scissors at the level of the top of the tube.
10. Replace the cap on the microcentrifuge tube and close completely.
11. Shake the tube briefly to free the cells from the brush.
12. Process the specimen within 48 hours after collection.
