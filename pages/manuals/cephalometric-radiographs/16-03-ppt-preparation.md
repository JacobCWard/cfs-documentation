## 16.3 Participant Preparation

The Research Assistant must obtain informed consent from each subject before taking the radiograph (or be aware that one is already on file).  Each participant must understand that radiographs involve exposure to radiation, and that prolonged exposure to radiation poses serious risks to the participant’s health.  The actual amount of radiation is well within established safety parameters, and the entire examination is actually quite similar to a full mouth series at the dentist. For safety sake, participants who are pregnant should not be invited to participate.

Allergies, particularly to Sulfa drugs and artificial sweeteners, should be assessed before the examination because of the use of a contrast material (Barium Sulfate) to bring out soft tissue in the radiograph.

A lead apron is used to protect the participant from scatter and unnecessary radiation.

The operator is **NOT** to be in the room with the participant when the film is exposed **UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**!  The cephalometrist remains outside the room, with the door closed, to expose the film.  The walls and doors of the ceph room at the Bolton-Brush Growth Study Center are lined with lead and offer an effective barrier from the radiation generated while taking the x-ray.

Additionally, a radiation exposure badge issued by the Department of Radiology at the Dental School is to be worn by the operator at **ALL** times when taking radiographs.  These badges are collected annually to test for levels of radiation experienced by the wearer.  Unusually high levels are investigated by Case Western Reserve University’s Department of Radiation Safety.
