## 16.5 Taking the Ceph

### 16.5.1 Assigning the Participant a Ceph Number

* New cephs are assigned the next sequential number available in the Ceph Log. This number is also burned into the x-ray with a lead plate in the dental school, along with the date of the film.
* Follow-up cephs are always assigned their original ceph number, with an “R” for 1st follow-ups, a “3” for Time 3, a “4” for Time 4 etc.
* It is the responsibility of the technician to track the ceph throughout the entire process.
* An x-ray film without a number burned into it is unusable and indistinguishable from all others.
