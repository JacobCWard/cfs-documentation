## 16.2 Staff Certification Requirements

The State of Ohio prohibits the taking of x-rays by anyone not licensed to do so by the State or its governing bodies.  Acceptable personnel would include:

* Orthodontists
* Dentists
* Physicians
* Medical auxiliary (already trained and licensed to do so)

Anyone not falling into one of the above categories MUST secure a license BEFORE taking any radiographs of participants.

In order to be licensed, candidates must attend a seminar on comprehensive dental radiology and clinical radiography training at the Dental School.  The Continuing Education Department arranges the seminar, and the Radiology Department provides clinical training.  Candidates must then schedule and pass a proficiency exam with the Ohio State Dental Board.  Topics covered in the examination cover radiation physics, radiation biology, safety, radiographic techniques and darkroom processing techniques.
Upon completion and licensure, proof of certification must be displayed at the Bolton-Brush Growth Study Center in the Dental School.

Additionally, candidates must attend a radiation safety course offered by CWRU.  This is a university requirement.
