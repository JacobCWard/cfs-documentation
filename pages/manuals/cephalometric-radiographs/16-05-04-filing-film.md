## 16.5.4 Filing the Film

In the main lab, there are a number of binders arranged numerically containing our collection of films and charts.  If the participant is new, they will have been assigned the next sequential C number.  If this is a follow-up examination, find the original x-ray and file the new one next to it in the same binder.

Place the radiographs and the Examination Record in 3-punch plastic sleeve and file appropriately.
