## 6.3.3 Wrist Circumference

* The measurer faces the subject who stands and flexes the arm at the elbow so that the palm is uppermost and the hand muscles relaxed.
* A tape is placed just distal to the styloid processes of the radius and ulna, which are located by palpating with the index or middle finger of each hand.
* The tape is positioned perpendicular to the long axis of the forearm and in the same plane on the anterior and posterior aspects of the wrist.
* The tape must be no more than 0.7 cm wide.
* The measurement is made with the tape touching the skin around the whole circumference but not compressing the soft tissue.
* The wrist circumference is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.
