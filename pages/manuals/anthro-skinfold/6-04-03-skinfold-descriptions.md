## 6.4.3 Skinfold Descriptions

### 6.4.3.1 Tricep Skinfold

The direction of fold for the tricep skinfold is vertical (midline).

1. The distance between lateral projection of acromial process and inferior margin of olecranon process is measured on lateral aspect of arm with elbow flexed 90° using a tape measure.
2. The midpoint is marked on the lateral side of the arm.
3. The fold is lifted 1 cm above marked line on posterior aspect of arm.
4. The caliper is then applied at the marked level.

### 6.4.3.2 Subscapular Skinfold

* The direction of fold for the subscapular skinfold is diagonal.
* The fold is along the natural cleavage line of skin, just inferior to the inferior angle of scapula, with the caliper applied 1 cm below fingers.

### 6.4.3.3 Midaxillary Skinfold

* The direction of fold for the midaxillary skinfold is horizontal.
* The fold is taken on the midaxillary line at the level of xiphisternal junction (the point where costal cartilage of ribs 5-6 articulate with the sternum, slightly above inferior tip of xiphoid process).

### 6.4.3.4 Suprailliac Skinfold

### 6.4.3.6 Chest Skinfold

* The fold is taken between axilla and nipple as high as possible on anterior axillary fold with measurements taken 1 cm below the fingers.

### 6.4.3.7 Bicep Skinfold

* The direction of fold for the bicep skinfold is vertical (midline).
* The fold is lifted over the belly of the biceps brachii at the level marked for the triceps and on line with the anterior border of the acromial process and the antecubital fossa.
* The caliper is applied 1 cm below fingers.

### 6.4.3.8 Thigh Skinfold

* The direction of fold for the thigh skinfold is vertical (midline).
* The fold is lifted on anterior aspect of thigh midway between inguinal crease and proximal border of patella.
* Body weight is shifted to the left foot and the caliper is applied 1 cm below fingers.

### 6.4.3.9 Calf Skinfold

For this measurement the subject should be sitting. The measurement should not be made over clothing.

1. The subject should sit in a chair with knees and hips flexed to a 90° angle.
2. The measurer bends down on the right side and has the subject raise their heel to flex the calf muscle (subject will be resting on the front ball of the foot, heel will be raised).
3. Using a non-stretching tape measure at the widest point on the calf. The measurement is taken at the widest point of the calf.
4. The direction of the calf skinfold is vertical. The measurement is taken 1 cm below the fingers.
