## 6.3.4 Mid-Upper Arm Circumference

* For this measurement the subject stands erect. With arms hanging freely at the sides of the trunk and with the palms facing the thighs.
* The subject wears loose clothing without sleeves to allow total exposure of the shoulder area.
* If the midpoint of the upper arm has been marked for the measurement of triceps or biceps skinfolds, this should be used as the level for the measurement of arm circumference.

1. To locate the midpoint, the subjectâ€™s elbow is flexed to 900 with the palm facing superiorly. The measurer stands behind the subject and locates the lateral tip of the acromion by palpating laterally along the superior surface of the spinous process of the scapula.
2. A small mark is made at the identified point.
3. The most distal point on the acromial process is located and marked.
4. A tape is placed so that it passes over these two marks, and the midpoint between them is marked.
5. With the arm relaxed and the elbow extended and hanging, just away from the side of the trunk and the palm facing the thigh, place the tape around the arm so that it is touching the skin, but not compressing the soft tissue.
6. The tape is positioned perpendicular to the long axis of the arm at the marked midpoint, and the circumference is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.
