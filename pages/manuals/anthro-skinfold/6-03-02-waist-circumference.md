## 6.3.2 Waist Circumference

* The subject should wear little clothing so that the tape may be correctly positioned. The measurement should not be made over clothing. If clothing must be worn, subjects should undress to light underwear and wear only a cloth or paper smock during the measurement.
* The subject stands erect with the abdomen relaxed, the arms at the sides and feet together. The measurer faces the subject and places an inelastic tape around the subject, at the level of the natural waist, which is the narrowest part of the torso.
* An assistant is needed to help position the tape in a horizontal plane.
* In some obese subjects, it may be difficult to identify a waist narrowing. In such cases, the smallest horizontal circumference should be measured in the area between the ribs and iliac crest.
* The measurement should be taken at the end of a normal expiration, without the tape compressing the skin. It is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.
