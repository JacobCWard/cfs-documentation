## 7.5 Procedure

**<u>MAKE SURE BED IS UNPLUGGED BEFORE STARTING THE BIA.</u>**

1. The participant should remove the right shoe and sock (generally the study is completed on the right side of the body). The body side (left or right) should always be used subsequently.
2. The participant should lie supine with arms 30 degrees from the body and legs not touching and remove jewelry on the electrode side.
3. The electrode sites may be cleaned with alcohol, particularly if the skin is dry or covered with lotion.
4. Attach the electrodes and patient cables as shown in Figure 1.
5. Turn the analyzer on and make sure the participant refrains from moving.
6. When the measurements have stabilized, record the displayed Resistance (R) and Reactance (Xc) with the participant’s name age, gender, height, and weight.
7. Remove and dispose of the electrodes, be careful not to injure the participant’s skin or contaminate the operator.
8. The entire testing time is less than 5 minutes – the BIA analyzer is on for less than one minute.
9. The results are available immediately from the software program.
10. The study may be repeated as often, as necessary.
