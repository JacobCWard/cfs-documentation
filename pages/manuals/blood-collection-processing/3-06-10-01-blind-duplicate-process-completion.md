## 3.6.10.1 Blind Duplicate Processing Completion

After aliquoting, cryovials are frozen immediately at –70°C in an upright position.  Completed, frozen blood sample 0.5 mL and 1.0 mL cryovials from blind duplicate participants are packed into one freezer box (5x5x2") with a 10x10 grid.  Urine blind duplicates and 4.0 mL cryovial blood blind duplicate samples for Fletcher Allen Health Care tests are packed into a tall freezer box (5x5x3") containing a 7x7 grid.

More than one participant’s samples are included in one box.  These samples are shipped at least one month after the original samples are sent out to the LCBR, so that the laboratory cannot match them with the original participant.   Include the completed Blind Duplicate Shipping Form when these frozen samples are shipped.

Cryovials must be labeled with a QC ID number to identify the sample.  This ID number is matched to the Participant ID number outside of the LCBR so that the LCBR cannot match the samples.  The QC ID number begins with 999.  The next 4 digits identify the participant and are matched to the Participant ID number at Case Western Reserve University.   The final digit identifies the type of tube that was drawn (1 = serum, 2 = citrate, 3 = EDTA and 4 = SCAT-1).   The 2 digit extension identifies the cryovial number (01 or 02): 99910001-01.

Continue with the blind duplicate draw order until at least 35 of each tube type have been drawn and properly processed.  There are extra QC numbers included in the QC labels to accommodate extra draws due to patient refusal and processing or blood draw problems.

After packing the boxes, wipe down all areas with 10% bleach solution (or approved biohazard disinfectant).
