## 3.6.10 Processing Completion

Enclose the completed Phlebotomy and Blood Processing Forms with each shipment of samples to the LCBR. (Be sure the Phlebotomy and Processing Forms are completely filled out.) Upon receipt at LCBR, forms and samples are examined for monitoring and QC purposes.

Completed, frozen cryovials, 4.0 mL tubes for Fletcher Allen Health Care (FAHC) tests, 10.0 mL packed cell and urine sample tubes from one participant are packed into one freezer box.  A participant label is attached to the front cover of the freezer box.  The 0.5 mL and 1.5 mL blood cryovials are packed in a 4 x 10 grid.

    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Do not pack any tubes in the first row of the grid.  The grid may shift during transport and the tubes will fall out.)  Urine, packed cell and FAHC tubes are placed lying down (after being completely frozen) in the same participantâ€™s box in the remaining space.
