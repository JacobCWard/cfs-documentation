### 3.4.1 Participant ID Labels

The LCBR will supply the GCRC with sheets of sample ID barcode labels to use for labeling forms, draw tubes, and cryovials.  These ID numbers will be different from the Participant ID number and care must be taken to correctly identify the Participant ID number on the collection and processing forms.  The assignment of the LCBR ID number will be made at the time of the first blood draw (10:30 PM).  If the scheduled participant cancels the visit, the LCBR ID number will be assigned to the next participant.

Each participant set of barcode labels has the same sample ID number.  For blood samples, the sample ID number is followed by a 1, 2 or 3 to designate the draw time (1 = 10:30 PM, 2 = 8:00 AM and 3 = 10:00 AM post glucose).  The cryovial labels also have a 2-digit extension (01 to 40) that serves as a unique identifier for each cryovial within a sample ID.  Urine samples will have a 4 following the 7 digit ID number.  This helps in tracking the repository.  See Appendix 2 for proper orientation of the barcode label on the cryovial. There will be a total of 64 labels:

* 1 label for the Case Western Reserve University form
* 3 labels for the Phlebotomy Forms
* 3 labels for the Blood Processing Forms
* 1 Label for the Urine Collection and Processing Form
* 9 labels for the draw tubes (plus 4 extra labels)
* 35 cryovial labels for the blood samples
* 2 labels for urine collection
* 5 labels for the urine samples
* 1 label for the freezer box.

It is essential that blood samples be precisely labeled throughout the collection and processing stages to ensure that participant samples are not miscoded.  It is also essential to properly label the samples to ensure that the three different blood draws are clearly defined. To facilitate accurate labeling, it is suggested that you pre-label sets of collection tubes and cryovials prior to the participant's visit.  Please do not tape over the cryovial labels.  Tape may interfere with the scanning of the cryovials when they arrive at the LCBR.
