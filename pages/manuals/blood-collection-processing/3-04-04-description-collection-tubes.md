## 3.4.4 Description of Collection Tubes

**<u>Tube #1 is a 10mL red-topped Serum tube (B-D 366430).</u>**

* Let these tubes stand at room temperature for a minimum of 40 minutes to allow the blood to clot. They are then centrifuged. Serum is aliquoted (1 clear-capped 4mL tube containing 1.0 mL and 3 red-capped 1.5mL cryovials which contain 1 mL each).
* _The serum will be tested for insulin and glucose levels as well as stored in repository for later analysis._

**<u>Tube #2 is a 5 mL  citrate  tube (B-D  366415).</u>**

* After centrifugation, the serum is aliquoted (4 blue-capped 0.5 mL cryovials which contain 0.5 mL each). Once the plasma is removed, the packed cells are removed into one 10 mL red-capped cryovial.
* _These samples will be used for coagulation testing and stored in repository for later analysis. The packed blood cells will be used for DNA extraction._

**<u>Tube #3 is a 10mL EDTA tube (B-D 366457).</u>**

* After centrifugation, plasma from this tube will be aliquoted (1 clear-capped 4 mL tube which contains 1 mL and 3 white-capped 1.5 mL cryovials which contain 1 mL each). Once the plasma is removed, the packed cells are removed into the 10 mL red-capped cryovial.
* _This plasma will be used for LDL level and banked for future testing._

**<u>Tube #4 is a 5mL red-topped "Special Coagulation" tube (SCAT-I) containing a white, powdered anticoagulant provided by the LCBR.</u>**

* This tube contains a special combination of anticoagulants that ensure long-term stability of the plasma sample.  Specifically, this tube, when filled, will contain 4.5 mM EDTA, 150 KIU/mL aprotinin and 20 uM D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone.  The SCAT-1 tube must be stored refrigerated. It must be drawn <u>after</u> at least one other tube has been drawn.
* **<u>NOTE</u>:** This tube is 'non-sterile', therefore it must be drawn using a butterfly apparatus with 12 inches of tubing; alternatively, a syringe may be used for the venipuncture, and expressed through the cap (with great care to limit turbulence) into the SCAT tube.
* <u>It is critical that the SCAT-1 tube is mixed well (>30 sec of gentle inversion) before being placed on ice to await further processing/centrifugation.</u>  The plasma will be aliquoted after centrifugation (4 yellow-capped 0.5 mL cryovials with 0.5 mL each).  Once the plasma is removed, the packed cells are removed into the 10 mL red-capped cryovial.
* _The plasma will be used for measuring inflammatory markers._
