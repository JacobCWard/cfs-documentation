## 3.6.3 Centrifugation

Once centrifugation is complete, tubes are carefully placed on ice and are ready to aliquot.

### 3.6.3.1 EDTA, SCAT-1, and Citrate Tubes

Begin processing EDTA, SCAT-1, and Citrate tubes within 15 minutes of venipuncture.  If centrifugation is not immediate, tubes are stored upright on wet ice for up to 30 minutes. Tubes are centrifuged at 4°C at a minimum of 2,000 x g for 15 minutes or 3,000 x g for 10 minutes (for a total of 30,000 g-minutes). Maximum time elapsed before centrifugation is 30 minutes from time of collection.  <u>Please note all start times on the Blood Processing Form.</u>  Once centrifugation is complete, tubes are carefully placed on ice and are ready to aliquot.

### 3.6.3.2 Serum

Allow the Serum tube to clot for at least 40 minutes at room temperature (maximum time before centrifugation is 90 minutes).  These tubes are centrifuged at 4°C at 2,000g for 15 minutes or 3,000g for 10 minutes for a total of 30,000 g-minutes. After centrifugation is complete, place on ice.
