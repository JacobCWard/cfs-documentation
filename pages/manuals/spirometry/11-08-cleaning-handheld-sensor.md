## 11.8 Cleaning the Handheld Sensor

1. Grip the outside knurled locking ring on the sensor and twist ¼” counterclockwise until a click is felt.  It is now released and can be pulled from the sensor housing, carrying with it the front-end cap and mouthpiece adapter. **<u>NOTE</u>:** Do not over twist the locking ring.  Excessive force will damage the sensor housing.
2. Inside the sensor housing, you will now see the plastic end blade of the flow sensor element (filter).  Pull gently on the blade to slide the sensor element from the housing.  The sensor can also be pushed from the housing using a finger inserted in the exit port.
3. Multispiro recommends cold sterilizing the flow sensor element in any solution that is a documented germicide against tuberculosis and other potentially harmful cross-contamination agents.  It is also recommended to sterilize the inside of the sensor with a germicidal pad such as Cide-Swipes.
4. Turn the sensor upside down, so that the two small holes inside the housing are at the top.  These are the pressure ports for the flow transducer.
5. Wipe the inside of the sensor housing with a germicidal pad.  Avoid pouring liquid into the pressure ports.  Do not immerse the sensor housing in fluid.
6. Sterilize the front-end cap, locking ring and mouthpiece adapter using a Cide-Swipe.  These removable parts may be immersed in fluid.
7. Reassemble the Multispiro sensor by inserting a new or clean filter into the front end of the sensor housing.  The sensor element end blades should be horizontal, that is, not covering the pressure ports in the bottom of the housing.
8. Push the filter fully into the housing.  One end blade should be visible from the exit port.
9. Put the locking ring over the top of the open sensor housing, covering the filter.
10. Align the slots of the locking ring with the locking tabs on the outside of the sensor housing.
11. Push the locking ring over the tabs and rotate the ring clockwise about 1/8 inch until snug at which point the sensor assembly is locked and ready to use. **Turning the locking ring farther than “snug” can damage the sensor.**
12. Push the mouthpiece adapter into the hole in the end cap until is seated and insert a disposable mouthpiece in the adapter to continue testing.
