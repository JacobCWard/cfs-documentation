## 11.5 Performing the Test

* 1. After properly preparing the patient and zeroing the sensor, you are now ready to perform the actual testing.  Press the **spacebar** to begin the test.
* 2. Perform the test, using some derivation of the following:

 _“Take in a deep cleansing breath, let it out. Take in another one, let it out.”_

 _“Take in a big, deep breath..."_

 _“Blast it out!”_

 _“Good, keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing...”_

 _“Stop. Okay, relax and breathe normally.”_

* 3. Press the **spacebar** to terminate the test.
* 4. Select **Y** to accept the test or N to discard it.  Sometimes it is necessary to accept a test even though it may contain certain error messages.  For instance, some patients cannot blow a full six seconds.  This does not make the test invalid.
* 5. Select **F2** for another test.  Repeat the previous steps until there are three or four accepted tests for the patient. If the patient experiences signs of respiratory distress or starts coughing severely, * faints, or feels light-headed during the procedure, stop the testing.
* 6. Select **F3 View** to view the side-by-side summaries.
* 7. Select** Pre-BD Side-By-Side Summary** from the F3 View pull-down menu.
* 8. A selection box will be displayed, providing a choice between **Automatic Best Test Selection** and Manual Best Test Selection. Select Automatic Best Test Selection.

 * If two or more tests are performed, up to three will be shown side-by-side with the best test in the left panel, 2nd best in the center panel and 3rd best in the right panel.
 * Along the bottom edge of the individual graphic displays are percentages, which determine the deviation between the three best tests.  The three tests should be within 5% of each other.

* 9. Once three tests within the 5% range have been achieved, you have reviewed them, and made the necessary changes regarding their ranks, press **Esc**. This will put you in the main menu.
* 10. Select **F1 Patient**.
* 11. From the pull-down menu, select **Save Patient Data**.
* 12. You will be asked to Save and Continue or Save and End Session.  Select **Save and End Session**
* 13. At this time, either continue testing other patients or select **F5 File**.
* 14. Select **Exit** from the F5 pull-down menu. This action gets you to the MS-DOS prompt.
* 15. Type **"Exit"** and this will put you into the Windows start-up menu
* 16. Select **Start**.
* 17. Select **Shutdown the Computer**.  Wait until the computer shuts itself off.
* 18. Disconnect the sensor and the power cord, pack up the equipment, and thank the participant(s) for participating in the testing.
