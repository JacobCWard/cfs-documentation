## 11.4 Preparing for Participant Testing

### 11.4.1 Entering Participant Data

* 1. Set up the laptop by connecting the Multispiro sensor, plugging in the power supply, and turning it on.
* 2. Restart Computer is MS-DOS Mode.
* 3. At the MS-DOS prompt, type **“cd..”** and **“sx”**.  This gets you to the Multispiro menu.

* 9. Enter the patient’s name, ID#, height, weight, birthdate, race, and any other pertinent information from the patient’s PHYSIO sheet such as medications.

 * Also note if the individual has a cold, sinus problems, or asthma.
 * If the patient indicates that he/she has asthma, ask if he/she has an inhaler, where it is, and the last time he/she used it.  Occasionally doing spirometry may precipitate an asthma attack so it is a good idea to have the inhaler handy to avoid any problems.
 * If the patient indicates that he/she has used the inhaler within the last two hours, note it in the comment section.
 * Also note if the Fev1 drops by 20% from the first test to the last test. If it has, recommend that the patient use the inhaler again <u>especially</u> if the test causes any discomfort. Also include the investigator’s name that performed the testing.

* 10. To complete patient data entry, press the **Esc** key.  A question will appear asking **“Save Changes? Y/N?”** Answer **Y** to update the file; N to abort.
* 11. At the main menu, select **F2 Test**.
* 12. Select **FVC TEST** from the F2 pull-down menu.
* 13. The system will display the incentive currently active and prompt the user to **Press Any Key to Zero the Sensor**. It is important not to move the sensor during the brief zeroing process.
* 14. After zeroing, a message will be displayed to **Press Any Key to Start Test**. Press a key and have the patient perform the testing.
