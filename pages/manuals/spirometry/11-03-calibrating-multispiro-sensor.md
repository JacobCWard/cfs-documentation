## 11.3 Calibrating the Multispiro Sensor

Calibration should be performed at least once per day if it is going to be used that day.  It is preferable to calibrate at the start of the day, before testing anyone. If you replace the flow sensor element it is advisable to re-calibrate to insure the same level of accuracy.

1. Obtain the three-liter MedScience syringe.
2. Connect the Multispiro sensor to the comm-port on the back of the laptop. Ensure that there is a flow sensor element (filter) inside the sensor chamber.
3. Plug in the laptop.
4. Turn on the power switch to the computer.
5. At the start of the Windows menu, click **Start**.
6. Select **Shut Down**.
7. Select **Restart in MS-DOS Mode**.
8. At the MS-DOS prompt, type **“cd..”**, then **“sx.”**  The computer will go directly to the Multispiro menu.
9. At the Multispiro menu, select **F7 Set Up** menu.
10. Select **Calibrate Sensor**.  You will be shown the temperature that the computer has measured at the flow sensor and asked if the sensor is at room temperature.
11. Select **Y** for yes.  If you answer N, you will then be asked to enter the air (syringe) temperature.  Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit.
12. The next screen will ask you if the syringe volume is exactly 3.000 liters.  Select **Y** for yes.  If you answer N, you will be prompted to enter the syringe volume.
13. You may now connect the syringe. Ensure the syringe fits tightly without any leaks.
14. Draw back the plunger.
15. A message will appear to **“Press Any Key to Zero Sensor”**. The sensor will be zeroed for calibration.
16. You will then be prompted to **Press Any Key to Start Test**.
17. When you press a key the prompt, **“Push Plunger in Smoothly Now, Then Listen for the Beep”** will be displayed.  Push the plunger all the way in and wait until you hear a beep.
18. Draw the syringe out when you see the prompt **“Pull Back Plunger Now”**. The speed with which you push in the plunger should not make a significant difference in the volume reading.
19. When you have completed the stroke, the program will report the volume as measured using the previous calibration factor.  If you are confident that the calibration was valid, you can accept the calibration test by answering **Y** to the question **“Was the Calibration Done Correctly?”**  If you press N, the calibration will be aborted and you will be prompted to repeat the calibration.
20. You will then be asked to **“Press Any Key to Zero Sensor”** prior to performing a post-calibration check using the newly computed calibration value.  The procedure is the same as the preliminary calibration.
21. After the injection and withdrawal of the syringe a prompt will appear as follows: **“Was Post-Calibration Done Correctly? Y/N”**.  If N is pressed the system will prompt you to inject the calibration syringe again.  This check should produce a value within 3% of the correct 3.00-Liter volume.
22. You will then be asked if you want to **“Save the Calibration Report”** for archival purposes.  Select **Y** for “yes”.
23. You will then be asked if you want to **“Print the Calibration Report”**. Select **N** for no.
24. At this point, either continue with spirometry testing or shut down the computer and pack all supplies in the Multispiro carrying case excluding the 3.00-Liter syringe.
25. To shut down the computer, select **F5 File**.
26. Type **"Exit"**.
27. At the WINDOWS menu, select **Start**.
28. Select **Shut Down** and wait for the computer to shut itself off.
