## 18.6.2 Summary of Scoring Process

Each study will be manually scored in the two passes:

During the first pass:

* Review the “lights” channel and manually set time of “lights off” and “lights on.”
* The EEG, EMG and EOG signals from each study will be reviewed on an epoch by epoch (30 s.) basis (screen).  Each epoch will be assigned a sleep stage. Periods of EEG change that meet the criteria for arousal will be marked.

During second pass:

* Respiratory data (airflow/abdominal/chest/saturation) will be reviewed on 5 minute pages.  The saturation channel will be edited for artifact and respiratory events will be marked manually according to the rules stated below.

Finally, the following will be done:

* The QS Form will be completed, indicating unusual patterns, reliability problems, and signal/study QA grades.
* The outlier program will be run, to identify implausible values.
* Participant Feedback Sleep Reports will be generated.
* The raw and scored files and summary reports will be saved, to the scoring hard drive.
