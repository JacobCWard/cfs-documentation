## 4.3 Urine Collection

### 4.3.1 Preparation

It is suggested that female participants may prefer to use a Nun’s hat for urine collection.  If so, follow the instructions provided with this collection kit. Male participants, and female participants if they would prefer to, may urinate directly into a specimen collection container.

Specimen containers for routine random urine collection should be chemically clean, and have a tight fitting lid to prevent leakage during transportation.  (Suggestion for standard sterile specimen container:  Lab Safety Cat# OR-29091).  The 1–2 L urine containers used to pool the overnight collection must be clearly labeled with Participant ID number.

Participants should empty their bladders prior to the 10:30 PM blood draw.   This urine will be discarded.   All urine voided between 11:00 PM and 8:00 AM will be collected.   The participant will ring the GCRC staff to collect the urine samples.

Rarely, a patient will refuse to provide a urine sample.  Please keep a list of the ID numbers   of any of these participants and identify which test they refused.

### 4.3.2 Instructions for Participant

The participant’s privacy should be assured. The following steps should be followed:

1. Wash hands before and after voiding.
2. Preferably cleanse area with antiseptic wipes prior to voiding (optional).
3. Remove the cap from the collection container and void into the container.
4. Carefully seal the cap of the container so that it is tight and leak proof.
5. Notify the GCRC staff to collect the sample.

The Urine Collection/Processing Form must be labeled with the Participant ID number and completed in ink.
