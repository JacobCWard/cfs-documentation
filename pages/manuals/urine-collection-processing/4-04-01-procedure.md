## 4.4 Urine Processing

### 4.4.1 Procedure

* 1. Label two containers with the Participant ID number.

 * The 7 digit ID number followed by a 4 denotes urine samples.
 * One container is just urine (no additives) and the other container has 25 mL of 1M acetic acid to preserve the urine (final pH < 3).
 * The containers should also be clearly marked with labels for the plain urine and the urine+acid. This can be done with colored labels if desired, a yellow label for the plain urine and a green label for the urine+acid.
 * To ensure safe handling of both the urine and acid preservative, the containers that will hold the overnight urine collections should be adequately sized (1–2 L) and have a wide mouth to facilitate addition of samples.
 * Containers with covers are advised.

* 2. Record the urine volume and time of collection each time the participant voids during the overnight urine collection.  The volume measurement can be approximate as this measurement does not need to be precise.
* 3. Divide the urine into two containers (1–2 L) and refrigerate (4°C) promptly (within 15 minutes) after removal from the participant’s room.

 * Urine and acid should be carefully decanted down the side of the containers to avoid splashing.

* 4. Once the first collection is received, measured and divided, swirl the urine and acid in the second container to mix the contents.  Take care to avoid splashing.

 * **<u>NOTE</u>:**  We recommend that this procedure be carried out in a fume hood.  While not toxic at the levels used for this study, acetic acid has a strong, unpleasant odor and the addition of acid to the urine may generate a small amount of heat.

* 5. Once the acid is added and the container is capped, the container can be safely removed for storage in the refrigerator.
* 6. The addition of subsequent urine samples to this container should also take place in the fume hood. The container can be removed from the refrigerator and the urine added in the hood. The container can then be re-capped and stored in the refrigerator until the next urine addition or processing.
