## 2.6 Determining The Peak Inflation Value

It is necessary to determine, for each participant, the pressure level to which the cuff is to be inflated for accurate measurement of the systolic pressure. (This is because the cuff pressure at the start of the reading should always exceed the systolic pressure—otherwise the first of the Korotkoff sounds will be missed.) This starting pressure is called the “peak inflation pressure” and is determined as follows:
