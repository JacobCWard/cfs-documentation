## 2.5 Application of Blood Pressure Cuff

1. The appropriate cuff (as determined in the arm measurement procedure) is placed around the bare upper left arm so that the midpoint of the length of the bladder lies over the brachial artery and the mid-height of the cuff is at heart level.  The lower edge of the cuff, with its tubing connections, should be placed about 1 inch above the natural crease across the inner aspect of the elbow.
2. The cuff is wrapped snugly about the arm, still with the palm of the participantâ€™s hand turned upward.
3. The wrapped cuff should be secured firmly by applying pressure to the locking fabric fastener over the area where it is applied to the cuff.
