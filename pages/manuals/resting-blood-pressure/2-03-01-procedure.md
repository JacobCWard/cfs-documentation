## 2.3.1 Procedure

1. With the participant in the supine position, holding the forearm horizontal, measure the arm length from the acromion (or bony extremity of the shoulder girdle) to the olecranon (or tip of the elbow), with a metric tape, allowing the tape to hang freely.
2. Mark the midpoint on the dorsal surface.
3. Have the participant relax the arm along the side of the body.
4. Measure the arm circumference by drawing the tape snugly around the arm at the level of the midpoint marking.

* Care must be taken to keep the tape horizontal.
* The tape should not indent the skin.
