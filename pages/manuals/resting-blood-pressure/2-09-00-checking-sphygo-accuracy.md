## 2.9 Checking Shygmomanometer for Accuracy

Checking the sphygmomanometer used to record manual blood pressure readings is accomplished by checking them for accuracy against a mercurial sphygmomanometer. This checks the hand held sphygmomanometer against the mercurial unit for accuracy.  If the unit is out of sync it should be returned for repair or a new one purchased. The new Parr units are marked with a Lifetime Certified stamp.
