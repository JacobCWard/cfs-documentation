## 2.4 Pulse Measurement

Part of the BP measurement procedure is the measurement of the pulse, as observed by palpation of the radial artery of the wrist. For simplicity, the left arm is to be used consistently for measurement of both pulse and BP. This measurement serves two purposes: (1) to document the resting heart rate at the time of examination: and (2) to permit detection of gross irregularities of heart rhythm which may affect the interpretation of the BP readings.

**_The measurement of pulse and BP is performed only after the participant has been lying down for at least 15 minutes without smoking._** The elbow and forearm should rest comfortably on the bed. With the palm of the hand turned upward, the radial pulse is palpated and counted for 30 seconds exactly. (The observer should not use the thumb to palpate the pulse.) The number of beats in 30 seconds is noted, multiplied by 2, and the product recorded as the heart rate.
