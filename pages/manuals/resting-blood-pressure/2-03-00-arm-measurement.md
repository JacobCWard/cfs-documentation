## 2.3 Arm Measurement

The proper cuff size must be used to avoid under- or over-estimating the correct BP. To determine the proper cuff size, the observer must measure the arm circumference at the midpoint of the arm. This measurement is taken on the left arm that has been bared from the shoulder. (If blood pressure is <u>known</u> to be different in the right vs. the left arm, use the arm with the higher pressure. In this circumstance, it must be assured that all BP readings are recorded on the same arm.)

After the initial determination of proper cuff size, this arm measurement does not need to be carried out at each measurement.
