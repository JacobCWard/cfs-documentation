## 19.4.4 Converting a File

1. At the appropriate computer, double click on the **Eden Convert** icon.
2. The computer will assume the path (c:\eden\data\).  You need to supply the filename.bin.  Type in the filename, just as you named it in the downloading procedure and include .bin at the end.
3. The computer will ask if you wish to create a file with the same name.  Type **‘Y’**.  DO NOT PRESS ENTER.
4. The computer will prompt you for patient’s name (first and last on same line), patient file number, month, day, and year of study.  Type in each time and press **Enter** to move on to the next item.  Please note that the month, day, and year are entered on separate lines.
5. When the file is done, close the program by clicking on the X in the far upper right corner of the screen.
6. Remember to go to the Monitor Control Log and check the ‘Cover\Split’ column.

After the study is both printed and digitized, answer **No** when the monitor asks whether to save the memory.
