## 19.4 Data Collection

The sleep study can be printed or digitized in either order, as long as the monitor’s memory is saved between steps (instructions below).  The following instructions deal first with data collection (Steps 1-4) and then monitor preparation (Steps 5-8).

### 19.4.1 Printing a Sleep Study

* 1. Locate the Monitor Log Book and record the date, monitor number, file name (refer to Section: Edentec Filenames), and place a checkmark in the ‘P’ column.  In the ‘Comments’ column, write the participant’s name.
* 2. Attach the power cord to the monitor.
* 3. Attach communications port cable between the monitor and the Edentrace Printer.
* 4. Be sure the printer is on and that the following settings are present on the back of the printer:

 * **Impedance Gain** – Normal
 * **Print Speed** – 0.5 mm/sec.

* 5. Hold down the print button on the front of the printer while turning on the monitor.  The monitor window will read ‘Data Being Sent’ and printing will begin at approximately Block 41.

 *  To change the paper – Open the printer door without turning the power off. Insert a pad of paper with the red marking on the bottom, in the back right corner.  Leave one sheet of paper hanging out and close the door.  The device will then self-load the paper.  Press the Print button to resume printing.

*  6. When you are done printing, the sleep study monitor will ask if you want to save the data.

 *  If the sleep study needs to be digitized, push the button directly under the word **Yes**. You will then be prompted to check signals, press **No**.  Then you will be prompted to setup, press **No**. You will need this data to download the study onto the computer.
 *  If you have already downloaded the data onto the computer, you may erase the memory.  When prompted if you want to erase the memory, select **Yes**.  It will then ask if you are sure, select **Yes**.  Remember do not erase the memory until you have printed and digitized the study.
