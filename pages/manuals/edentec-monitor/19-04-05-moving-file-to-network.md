5. Paste all the files from the C drive to the Family folder.  All of the Eden files should now appear in this directory.
6. Once you have successfully copied these files, go back to the c:\eden\data folder and delete the files from this drive.  If you are confident with the computer, you can also use the cut and paste command, which means that you do not need to go back to delete the files in the c:\ drive.
