## 19.2 Prepping the Monitor

### 19.2.1 Set Up Mode

* 1. Attach and plug in the power cord in the bottom right-hand corner of the back panel of the monitor.
* 2. Hold down the left button on the front of the monitor.
* 3. Flip the power switch to **ON**.  The power switch is located above the power input.
* 4. The window on the front of the monitor will read ‘Set up mode’.  Select Yes by pressing the button located directly below that option.
* 5. Select **Yes** for each channel to accept or **No** to change.  (Selecting ‘No’ repeatedly will scroll the options for that channel.  Eventually, the originally option will return.)

 * **Channel 1:** Heart rate
 * **Channel 2:** Impedance
 * **Channel 3:** Airflow
 * **Channel 4:** Oximeter

* 6. Be sure the time and date are accurate.  Select **Yes** to accept or **No** to change.
* 7. For the sensor alarm option, typically **No** will be selected.
* 8. After the last option, the window will read ‘Set up mode’.  Select **No** to continue.

### 19.2.2 Connect New Sensors to Their Respective Leads

1. <u>Oximeter</u> – Remove oximeter from its wrapper and insert the plastic clip into the slot on the end of the oximeter (finger probe).
2. <u>Airflow</u> – Open one end of the wrapper and slide the thermistor out.  Insert the flap into the slot of the airflow cable (multisensory cable).  If cable doesn’t have snap-on ends, secure thermistor with tape.  Replace open wrapper over thermistor to keep it clean.
3. <u>EKG Pads</u> – Wait to connect until after checking signals
4. Connect the multisensory cable and the oximeter cable to their respective ports on the right side of the monitor.
5. Once you have completed the cleaning and prepping the monitor, make sure you check the appropriate column in the Monitor Control Log.

### 19.2.3 Check Signals

1. <u>Heart Rate</u> – Wet the snaps on the EKG leads with a little water.  Place the EKG lead between the index fingers and the thumb. The white R lead should between the right index finger and thumb; the black L lead should be between left index finger and thumb. The display window should register the pulse.
2. <u>Impedance</u> – Wet the snaps again and place on either side of the soft, fleshy space between the thumb and index finger of the same hand.  Slowly squeeze and release the fist.  In the display window, a solid bar should slide back and forth.  Remove two EKG pads from their wrapper and snap on to the EKG leads (multisensory cable).  Secure with tape over snap.
3. <u>Airflow</u> – Attach a thermistor and gently torch the sensors.  In the display window, a solid bar should slide back and forth.
4. <u>Oximetry</u> - Attach a disposable oximeter and affix to the index finger.  The display should register the O2 in about 10 seconds.
