## 12.13.1.1 Figure 1 Digital Screen of Rhinometry Testing Program

MISSING_IMAGE

This graphic represents the digital screen of the Rhinometry testing program.  This graphic reveals the following:

* This is the post nasal steroid test; thus, the screens are labeled “BEFORE” (The post test will look markedly similar)
* Test #4, featured on the graphic, is a bit noisy—this is indicated by the dots around the line (scatter) this is due to an inconsistent seal on the nostril by the tester
* Otherwise, all the tests are acceptably consistent
